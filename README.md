Waldre Roos 42386802 Virtual CV
Overview
This document outlines the structure and elements of my virtual CV. This website is a digital profile showcasing my skills, experience, projects, and achievements.

The project is organized with separate folders for CSS files, JavaScript files, images, and fonts, making it easier to manage and maintain the different components of the website.

For the design, I chose a personal photo as the background of the page. I added a slight zoom effect as you scroll through the content, along with a shadow behind the text to enhance readability. The fonts I selected are Humble Nostalgia and Pacifico.
